                <br><br>
                Greetings! Our motto: "Global News for a Global Era!"
                <br><br>
                Overview: During this project, we are the (imaginary) 'Global Herald Newspaper' team! 
                We don't actually exist, yet with this scenario, we are the Newspaper that is supposedly
                running this Election Machine. Our aim is to help election voters get matched with the
                right candidate for them!
                <br><br>
                In order to create this Election Machine, we 'hired' the HÄMK's Finest server programming team.
                This team is comprised of student server programmers from HÄMK polytechnic university, and
                they created this Election Machine using Java server-side programming.         
                <br><br>
                Read on to meet the server programming team!
